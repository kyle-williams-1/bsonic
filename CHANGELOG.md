# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.8.0-beta.1]

### Added

- **Default fields support** for free text queries without requiring text indexes
- `ParseWithDefaults()` function for specifying default fields per query
- `WithDefaultFields()` config method for parser-level default field configuration
- Wildcard and regex support in default field queries

### Removed

- **MongoDB text search support** - Removed `$text` operator functionality, replaced with default field searches for better Lucene compatibility and performance
- `WithEnableTextSearch()` config method

### Changed

- Free text queries with default fields use case-insensitive regex by default
- ParseWithDefaults takes priority over config-level default fields

## [v0.7.0-beta.1]

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Renamed BSON formatter to MongoDB formatter** (`config.FormatterBSON` â†’ `config.FormatterMongo`)
- Moved formatter from `formatter/bson/` to `formatter/mongo/` for better clarity

### Added

- Enhanced developer documentation with architecture overview
- Reorganized test structure with language-formatter specific test directories

### Migration

Update your code to use the new formatter name:

```go
// Old
cfg := config.Default().WithFormatter(config.FormatterBSON)

// New
cfg := config.Default().WithFormatter(config.FormatterMongo)
```
